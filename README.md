## Adding new scripts

`sequencer-scripts` repo is restricted and limited people have admin access to make changes to master and merge pull requests.

Script writers should follow steps mentioned below to add/update scripts

1. Fork `sequencer-scripts` repo
    1. One can fork it to their personal repository and keep working on that fork
    1. Or fork it under your own organization

1. Add new scripts into`scripts` directory under specific `subsystem`. If 
   your subsystem doesn't exist, create a directory with the name of your subsystem in the `scripts` directory, 
   e.g. `scripts/wfos`. Also add an observing mode mapping configuration file to provide a mapping from 
   observing modes to scripts in your new directory named your subsystem with the `.conf` extension, 
   e.g. `scripts/wfos/wfos.conf`. Then, include the new configuration file in the `scripts/application.conf`, 
   for example, if you have newly created `scripts/wfos/wfos.conf`, 
   then add line `include "wfos/wfos.conf"` in `scripts/application.conf` file

1. Add an entry for each observing mode into the subsystem-specific observing mode mapping configuration. It 
   should include a `scriptClass` property pointing to script file where script logic resides, for example,

    ```hocon
      scripts {
        iris {
          IRIS_darknight {
            scriptClass = iris.Darknight
          }
        }
      }
    ```

    Note: the same script class can be used for multiple observing modes.

1. Once all the changes are completed in a forked repo, then you can submit 
   a pull request to upstream which is `tmtsoftware/sequencer-scripts` repo in this case

1. Admins of `sequencer-scripts` repo will then review changes and merge it to `master`

## Running script

### Prerequisite

The [CSW](https://github.com/tmtsoftware/csw) services need to be running before starting the components.
This is done by starting the `csw-services`
If you are not building csw from the sources, you can run `csw-services` as follows:

- Install `coursier` using steps described [here](https://tmtsoftware.github.io/csw/apps/csinstallation.html) and add TMT channel.
- Run `cs install csw-services`. This will create an executable file named `csw-services` in the default installation directory.
- Run `csw-services --help` to get more information.
- Run `csw-services start` to start all the csw services, for example, Location, Config, Alarm, AAS service etc

### Running Sequencer App with script

1. Run `sbt` command at root level of this repo

1. Within the `sbt` shell, run following command which will read _scripts.Subsystem.Observing_Mode.scriptClass_ configuration and start that script.

    ```bash
        run sequencer -s <Subsystem> -m <Observing_Mode>
    ```

    Please note that configuration for IRIS (subsystem) and IRIS_darknight (observing mode) should be there in
    config file.

    For example, following command will start IRIS IRIS_darknight script i.e. **_Darknight.kts_** script
    Confiuration for this exist in iris.conf file under iris scripts folder.

    ```bash
        run sequencer -s IRIS -m IRIS_darknight
    ```

1. At this stage, your `Sequencer` will be started with provided `script` and waiting for `Sequence` to be received for execution

## Submitting Sequence to Sequencer

Once you have started `Sequencer` with appropriate `script`, next step would be to submit a `Sequence` to the `Sequencer` for execution.

Use [esw-shell](https://github.com/tmtsoftware/esw/tree/master/esw-shell) to do this and more which has detailed documentation on how to submit sequence to sequencer.
